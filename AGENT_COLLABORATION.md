# Live Collaboration Handoff

Use the [stable guide on master](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/blob/master/AGENT_COLLABORATION.md) for architecture, ownership, testing, and context-loading rules. This deliberately unmerged branch contains only changing coordination state; keep design rationale in the TODO, issue, or PR.

**Standing queue:** when you have no assigned task, take the next `todo` job in [`JOBS_FOR_CHATGPT.md`](JOBS_FOR_CHATGPT.md); the owner asked Claude to queue it. Keep this paragraph when condensing this file.

## Baseline and active follow-ups

- **Master:** [`22e5c4f`](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/commit/22e5c4f124b61b24a6e66c87adef33e5fc9c756e). PRs #81–#92 (excluding issue-only numbers #93–#96), #97, #99, and #100 are merged; #98 remains an open issue; PR #101 is open for review.
- **Latest merged-code verification:** [PR #83](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/pull/83), CI [run #749](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/actions/runs/39081978883): 1,427 passed, 1 failed, 1 xfailed; coverage passed; enforced fixtures 81/81; informational fixtures 69/70. The sole failure is issue #75.
- **[PR #84](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/pull/84), status/docs cleanup:** makes `todos.txt` the source for suite counts, removes stale README claims, and corrects next-work guidance. CI [run #758](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/actions/runs/39085002613) has only the known #75 failure.
- **[PR #85](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/pull/85), declaration consolidation:** removes the redundant `elaborate_typed_declaration` path and moves sequence-aware declaration-recipe dispatch into the active surface-AST path, with a two-clause recipe regression test. CI [run #760](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/actions/runs/39085118117): 1,428 passed, 1 failed, 1 xfailed; coverage passed; enforced 81/81; informational 69/70. The new test passes; only #75 fails.

## One known blocker

[Issue #75](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/issues/75) is the sole test failure, `pytest_tests/test_set_axioms.py::test_zfc_remaining_axioms_fixture_all_pass`. WLOG replay changes `x=a` to `x=b`, then wrongly substitutes the invariant pair characterization on line 3. Preserve an original visible citation when it remains valid, remapping only when necessary. **This touches Claude-owned `source/ProofLogic.py`; coordinate with Claude before editing.** Do not weaken tests or mask the failure.

The named axiom rules are implemented. Retiring generic `(Axiom)` citations remains an owner decision. Arbitrary-property WLOG, `Mutatis mutandis`, and symbolic defining-property behavior remain deferred.


## J8 — Negative set phrases (PR #100)

Merged into master after CI confirmed the new oracle cases pass. The change supports the 12 readings from [finding #93](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/issues/93) in `source/SetTheory.py` and `parse_oracle/negated_set_phrases.txt`, with no generic connective parser or kernel change.

## J9 — Union, intersection, and disjointness phrases (PR #101)

Ready for owner review: [PR #101](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/pull/101), tested head [`230a5a9`](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/commit/230a5a946ca5f942d30ce6200bf4cedb5f36df30), CI [run #816](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/actions/runs/39182587319).

The change supports all 12 intended readings from [finding #94](https://github.com/axiomtutor/SyLoPy/issues/94) in `source/SetTheory.py` and `parse_oracle/set_operations_phrases.txt`. Phrases with conjunction-looking "and" are kept whole using the set-theory phrase-span path. The surface operations lower into ordinary logic; no set-operation terms or kernel behavior are added. The unchanged intended formulas all pass.

Verification: 1,491 passed, 1 failed, 1 xfailed; coverage passed; enforced fixtures 140/140; informational fixtures 79/80. All 12 J9 oracle cases pass. Sole failure: known deferred #75 `Mutatis mutandis` in `pytest_tests/test_set_axioms.py::test_zfc_remaining_axioms_fixture_all_pass`. No existing test or proof fixture was weakened.
